Omics_lyn_fibro_CLL
-------------------------------------

Omics data integration (four “ome” layers) was performed by applying a multi-step approach, where each “ome layer” was analyzed individually and further results were combined. In-house pipelines merging several R packages were written and followed for the individual analyses. They include pre-processing steps, normalization, logarithmic transformation and differentially expressed genes/proteins identification. All files are provided here.
