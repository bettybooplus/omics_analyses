Omics_lyn_fibro_CLL
-------------------------------------

Omics data integration (four “ome” layers) was performed by applying a multi-step approach, where each “ome layer” was analyzed individually and further results were combined. An in-house pipeline merging several R packages was written and followed, including pre-processing steps, normalization, logarithmic transformation and subsequently, differentially expressed genes/proteins were identified. Individual files for the analyses are provided here.
